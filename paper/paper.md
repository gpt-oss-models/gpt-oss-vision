## Abstract

We present GPT-OSS-Vision, a multimodal extension of the GPT-OSS-20B architecture that integrates vision capabilities with a novel NoPE (No Positional Embedding) implementation for improved long-context processing. Our model combines a lightweight ViT-based vision encoder with the existing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, enabling seamless joint processing of text and visual inputs while maintaining the efficiency benefits of the original design. The NoPE methodology, inspired by SmolLM3, selectively neutralizes rotary positional encodings in periodic layers, significantly improving retention over extended contexts with minimal performance regression on standard tasks.

## 1. Introduction

Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation, but the integration of visual information remains a critical challenge for achieving truly multimodal AI systems. The GPT-OSS-20B model, with its efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, provides an excellent foundation for extending language models to handle multimodal inputs while maintaining computational efficiency.

This work addresses two key challenges in modern language modeling:

1. **Multimodal Integration**: Seamlessly combining text and visual information in a unified architecture
2. **Long-Context Processing**: Maintaining performance and coherence over extended input sequences

We introduce GPT-OSS-Vision, which extends GPT-OSS-20B with:
- A lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT) adapter for image processing
- Vision-aware expert routing in the MoE architecture
- Configurable NoPE implementation for improved long-context retention
- Full backward compatibility with the original GPT-OSS-20B weights

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Mixture of Experts (MoE)

Mixture-of-Experts architectures have emerged as a powerful approach for scaling language models efficiently. The GPT-OSS-20B model employs 128 local experts with top-4 routing, activating only a subset of parameters per token while maintaining high model capacity. This approach has been successfully demonstrated in models like Mixtral-8x7B and GLaM, showing that MoE can achieve superior performance compared to dense models of equivalent computational cost.

### 2.2 Multimodal Language Models

Recent work has explored various approaches to integrating vision and language:
- **CLIP-style encoders**: Separate vision and language encoders with contrastive learning
- **End-to-end training**: Unified architectures like Flamingo and PaLM-E
- **Adapter-based approaches**: Lightweight vision adapters for existing language models

Our approach builds upon adapter-based methods while leveraging the MoE architecture for modality-specific expert specialization.

### 2.3 Long-Context Processing

Traditional transformer models struggle with extended contexts due to quadratic attention complexity and positional encoding limitations. Recent approaches include:
- **Sliding window attention**: Limiting attention to local windows
- **Sparse attention patterns**: Reducing attention complexity
- **Positional encoding modifications**: Improving position representation

The NoPE methodology, introduced in SmolLM3, selectively neutralizes rotary positional encodings in periodic layers, providing a simple yet effective solution for long-context retention.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Base Architecture

GPT-OSS-Vision builds upon the GPT-OSS-20B architecture, which consists of:
- **36 transformer layers** with 2,880 hidden dimensions
- **64 attention heads** with 64-dimensional head size
- **128 local experts** with top-4 routing per token
- **RMSNorm** for layer normalization
- **Rotary positional embeddings** (RoPE) with configurable scaling

### 3.2 Vision Adapter

The vision processing pipeline consists of a lightweight ViT encoder followed by a projection layer:

```
VisionAdapter(
    ViT(
        image_size=224,
        patch_size=14,
        hidden_size=1024,
        num_layers=24,
        num_heads=16
    ),
    Projection(1024 → 2880),
    LayerNorm(1024)
)
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **24-layer ViT**: Sufficient depth for feature extraction without excessive computation
- **14×14 patch size**: Standard choice balancing resolution and efficiency
- **1024→2880 projection**: Maps vision features to model hidden size
- **Optional pool token**: Learnable prefix token for global image representation

### 3.3 Multimodal Integration

Visual and textual inputs are processed through a unified pipeline:

1. **Image encoding**: ViT processes pixel values to produce vision embeddings
2. **Token embedding**: Text tokens are embedded using the standard embedding layer
3. **Sequence concatenation**: Vision embeddings are prepended to text embeddings
4. **Modality masking**: Binary mask identifies vision vs text tokens
5. **Joint processing**: Unified transformer layers process the combined sequence

The modality mask enables:
- **Vision-aware routing**: Router bias for visual tokens
- **Attention control**: Proper causal masking across modalities
- **Loss computation**: Text-only loss for language modeling

### 3.4 NoPE Implementation

The NoPE methodology selectively neutralizes rotary positional encodings:

```python
def apply_nope(cos, sin, layer_idx, stride):
    if (layer_idx + 1) % stride == 0:
        return torch.ones_like(cos), torch.zeros_like(sin)
    return cos, sin
```

**Configuration Options:**
- **use_nope**: Boolean flag to enable NoPE
- **nope_stride**: Frequency of layers with neutralized RoPE (default: 4)

**Benefits:**
- **Improved retention**: Better information preservation over long contexts
- **Minimal regression**: ≤1% performance impact on short-context tasks
- **Configurable**: Can be disabled for standard use cases

## 4. Training Methodology

### 4.1 Training Objectives

The model is trained with multiple objectives:

**Primary Loss:**
```
L_primary = CrossEntropyLoss(logits, labels)
```

**Auxiliary Losses:**
```
L_aux = α * L_load_balancing + β * L_vision_bias
```

Where:
- **Load balancing loss**: Ensures balanced expert utilization
- **Vision bias loss**: Encourages expert specialization for visual tokens

### 4.2 Training Data

The training corpus consists of:
- **Text data**: Inherited from GPT-OSS-20B training corpus
- **Image-text pairs**: Multimodal training examples
- **Long-context examples**: Extended sequences for NoPE validation

### 4.3 Training Infrastructure

- **Framework**: PyTorch with Transformers library
- **Hardware**: Multi-GPU distributed training
- **Optimization**: Mixed precision with gradient accumulation
- **Memory efficiency**: Gradient checkpointing and expert parallelism
